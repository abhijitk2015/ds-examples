Spark is an exciting big data framework which allows us to access big data. R is mostly known for in-memory processing, but with 
Spark, R can very efficiently run on large clusters of Big Data from the comfort of your RStudio.


First, let's install the "sparklyr" package.

```{r}
install.packages("sparklyr")
library("sparklyr")
```


Let's install Spark 2.1.0  We actually can do this directly from R without having to do anything special.

```{r}
spark_install(version = "2.0.2", hadoop_version = "2.7")
```

Spark can be run either remotely or locally.  Locally is mainly just used for test and development, as running at scale is going to be largely remote on a large cluster.

Let's first try connecting locally.

```{r}
sc <- spark_connect(master = "local")
```

Great! We've now connected to our Spark local cluster.

Spark works by loading datasets to the cluster.  Normally, these are big datasets, too big to fit on a single machine. However,
we can test and get started by parallelizing local data. Let's start with the iris dataset.

```{r}
iris_tbl <- copy_to(sc, iris)
```

### Spark SQL

Let's use Spark SQL to query our Iris table.  Spark SQL allows us to use SQL like syntax to query data.

```{r}
library(DBI)
iris_preview <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM iris LIMIT 10")
iris_preview
```

Awesome... did you see the iris data?  That means we put the data in Spark, and then we can use SQL to query it.

Now let's try to look at our Spark cluster to see what jobs we may have run.

```{r}
spark_web(sc)
```

Viola!  Did you notice the Spark UI.  Notice how you have had several jobs run on this session. Click on the latest one to see some statistics on your job.


### Using Dplyr

Part of dplyr's utility is being able to use the same verbs for data on in-memory as well as on-disk data.  We can also use that on remote spark data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
flights_tbl <- copy_to(sc, nycflights13::flights, "flights")
```


Now, let's try some more queries with this.

```{r}
delay <- flights_tbl %>% 
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), dist = mean(distance), delay = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
  filter(count > 20, dist < 2000, !is.na(delay)) %>%
  collect
```

### Bonus: Connecting to a Remote Spark Cluster

Ask your instructor for the IP address of a remote spark cluster.  We are going to connect in clustger mode.

```{r}
sc <- spark_connect(master = "spark://REMOTEIPADDRESS:7077")

```

Now let's try deploying that Iris table again


```{r}
iris_tbl <- copy_to(sc, iris)
```

We had to do that again because this time we're connecting to the remote server.  Now let's try our Sark SQL command again.


```{r}
library(DBI)
iris_preview <- dbGetQuery(sc, "SELECT * FROM iris LIMIT 10")
iris_preview
```
